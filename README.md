Mod for CDDA that adds a variety of youkai and kami to interact with, or even become. All builds are currently for the experimental versions of C:DDA. Special thanks to Bismuth Borealis for laying the groundwork for the kitsune.

Latest update changes the kitsune tranformation abilites. Rather than being directly linked to a mutation ability, the ability to shapeshift is now controlled through a spell. The precursor to the transformation spell is obtained when you reach the kitsune threshold, and can be leveled until you obtain the transformation ability. The transformation has no effect on mutations outside of the kitsune branch. The test kami is now supposed to sell star pearls.
A few Ninjutsu "ninpo" abilities have been added, and the relevant scroll should be available at the test kami shrines. A couple ninja items have been added as well. Reworked how kitsune mutation works. Star Pearls no longer mutate on their own, but can still be used to create mutagen. Those who have reached the Kitsune threshold can use pearls to expand their powers and gain additional tails. Rates of success scale with character intelligence. 


TO DO:
- Remove dependency on Magiclysm. Eventually I want this mod to have it's own standalone magic system based on the 5 Eastern elements/phases (Water, Fire, Earth, Wood, Metal)
- Expand on NPCs. I plan on adding in at least another NPC to teach ninpo techniques and establish proper dialogue options when conversing with them
